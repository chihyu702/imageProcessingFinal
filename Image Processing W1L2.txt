Image Processing W1L2

Recap:
Quantization:
- making the measured values discrete
- Binary images: two possible values (0 and 1)

Histograms:
- histograms are frequency distributions of values.
- for images, they describe how often each pixel value occurs.
[
Exposure:
- exposure problems occur if one end of the intensity range is not used.
- image is then either underexposed (too dark) or overexposed (too light).

Contrast:
- Contrast problems occur when not the full range of values is used.
- contrast is defined as a_high - a_low, the highest and lowest intensity value in the image.

Dynamic range:
- dynamic range is the number of distinct pixel values.
- the maximum possible dynamic range equals the contrast + 1
- high dynamic ranges are usually preferred for image processing; they contain more detail.


Image defects:
- a histogram does not provide spatial information but can still reveal insights regarding the quality of the image.
- often, the histogram is smooth, meaning the neighboring bins have similar counts. 
- image compression can also lead to image defects; dynamic range is reduced with GIF compression.
- novel patterns with novel intensity values emerge with JPEG compression.

Binning:
- When a histogram has many bins, visualisation becomes less intuitive.
- Histogram becomes too large to visually appreciate.
- many bins might be empty.

Color image histograms:
- alternatively, we can plot histograms for each color channel.
- each histogram encodes the intensity of a single color channel.

Point Operations:
- point operations modify pixel values based only on their value.
- size, geometry and local structure of the image are not affected.
- they map original pixel (intensity) values to new values.
- point operations are typically used to change image contrast and brightness and to quantize (bin) the image.
- Since we deal with images with discrete values, point operation f() can be implemented as a look-up table.

Thresholding an image:
- with thresholding, we separate the intensity values of an image into two classes based on a threshold value a_th.
- result is a binary image.

Effect on histogram:
- since point operations operate on intensity values, not pixels, their effect on the histogram is typically clear:
	- increasing brightness results in a shift to the right.
	- inverting an image mirrors the histogram.
- realise that a histogram bin stays or moves entirely to a new bin.


Contrast adjustment:
- automatic contrast adjustment is a point operation that maximises contrast.
- essentially stretches the histogram such that the maximum range is used.
- stretching causes histogram gaps.

Modified auto-contrast:
- incidental high and low values have a large effect on contrast adjustment.
- can be solved by "ignoring" a fixed percentage q_low of the lowest and q_high of the highest values.


Histogram equalization:
- histogram equalization is the point operation that modifies the histogram to a uniform distribution of intensity values.
- an approximation because bins can merge and shift, but not split.
- a uniform histogram implies a linearly increasing cumulative histogram.
- motivation: contrast will be maximum; gaps and spikes are common, dynamic range might decrease.
